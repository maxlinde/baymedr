# baymedr: BAYesian inference for MEDical designs in R

`baymedr` is an R package with the goal of providing researchers with
easy-to-use tools for the computation of Bayes factors for common
biomedical research designs (see van Ravenzwaaij et al., 2019).
Implemented are functions to test the equivalence (`equiv_bf()`),
non-inferiority (`infer_bf()`), and superiority (`super_bf()`) of an
experimental group (e.g., a new medication) compared to a control group
(e.g., a placebo or an already existing medication). A special focus of
`baymedr` lies on a user-friendly interface, so that a wide variety or
researchers (i.e., not only statisticians) can utilise `baymedr` for
their analyses.

The Bayesian approach to inference has several advantages over the
conventional frequentist approach. To mention only a few, with Bayesian
inference it is legitimate to monitor results during data collection and
decide to stop or continue data collection based on the inspection of
interim analyses. This is considered a bad practice within the
frequentist framework because it would result in an inflated Type I
error rate (e.g., Schönbrodt et al., 2017). Furthermore, null hypothesis
significance tests and the corresponding *p*-values do not allow for the
quantification of evidence for the null hypothesis (e.g., Wagenmakers et
al., 2018). The Bayesian framework remedies this shortcoming, which is
particularly important for the equivalence design (van Ravenzwaaij et
al., 2019). Lastly, in some situations the frequentist approaches to
equivalence and non-inferiority tests bear certain interpretational
ambiguities. For instance, when the confidence interval of the
difference between the two group means fully lies between the
non-inferiority margin and 0, this means that the experimental group is
non-inferior with regard to the non-inferiority margin but inferior with
regard to 0. The same applies to the equivalence design (van Ravenzwaaij
et al., 2019). Fortunately, these ambiguities are fully resolved within
the Bayesian framework. For a more thorough discussion of Bayesian
advantages, see, for example, Wagenmakers et al. (2018).

## Installation and attaching

You can install the latest development version of `baymedr` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/), using the `devtools` package, with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maxlinde/baymedr")
```

Subsequently, you can attach `baymedr`, so that it is ready to use:

``` r
library(baymedr)
```

## General usage

All three functions for the three research designs (i.e., equivalence,
non-inferiority, and superiority) allow the user to compute Bayes
factors based on raw data (if arguments `x` and `y` are defined) or
summary statistics (if arguments `n_x`, `n_y`, `mean_x`, `mean_y`,
`sd_x`, and `sd_y` are defined). If summary statistics are used, the
user has the option to specify `ci_margin` and `ci_level` instead of
`sd_x` and `sd_y`. In general, arguments with ‘x’ as a name or suffix
correspond to the control group and those with ‘y’ as a name or suffix
refer to the experimental group.

Usage of the functions for equivalence (`equiv_bf()`), non-inferiority
(`infer_bf()`), and superiority designs (`super_bf()`), results in S4
objects of classes `baymedrEquivalence`, `baymedrNonInferiority`, and
`baymedrSuperiority`, respectively. Summary information are shown in the
console by printing the created S4 object. To extract the Bayes factor
from one of the three S4 objects, use the function `get_bf()`.

The Bayes factors resulting from `super_bf()` and `infer_bf()` quantify
evidence in favour of the alternative hypothesis (i.e., superiority and
non-inferiority, respectively), which is indicated by BF01. In contrast,
the Bayes factor resulting from `equiv_bf()` quantifies evidence in
favour of the null hypothesis (i.e., equivalence), indicated by BF01. In
case the evidence for the other hypothesis is desired, the user can take
the reciprocal of the Bayes factor (i.e., BF01 = 1 / BF10 and BF10 = 1 /
BF01).

## The Cauchy prior distribution

Bayesian inference requires the specification of a prior distribution,
which mirrors prior beliefs about the likelihood of parameter values.
For the equivalence, non-inferiority, and superiority tests, the
parameter of interest is the effect size between the experimental and
control conditions (see, e.g., Rouder et al., 2009; van Ravenzwaaij et
al., 2019). If relevant information is available, this knowledge could
be expressed in an idiosyncratic prior distribution. Most of the time,
however, relevant information is missing. In that case, it is reasonable
to define a prior distribution that is as objective as possible. It has
been argued that the Cauchy probability density function represents such
a function (see, e.g., Rouder et al., 2009). The standard Cauchy
distribution resembles a standard Normal distribution, except that the
Cauchy distribution has less mass at the centre but instead heavier
tails. The centre of the distribution is determined by the location
parameter, while the width is specified by the scale parameter. By
varying the scale of the Cauchy prior, the user can change the range of
reasonable effect sizes. This is accomplished with the argument
`prior_scale`.

## Random example data

In order to demonstrate the three functions within `baymedr`, we create
an example dataset (data). There is a control group “con” and an
experimental group “exp” (condition). Further, random numbers, sampled
from the Normal distribution, within each group are created, serving as
the dependent variable of interest (dv):

``` r
set.seed(123456789)

data <- data.frame(
  condition = rep(x = c("con", "exp"),
                  c(150, 180)),
  dv = c(rnorm(n = 150,
               mean = 7.3,
               sd = 3.4),
         rnorm(n = 180,
               mean = 8.9,
               sd = 3.1))
)

data[c(1:5, 151:155), ]
#>     condition        dv
#> 1         con  9.016566
#> 2         con  8.645978
#> 3         con 12.112828
#> 4         con  4.844097
#> 5         con  5.197586
#> 151       exp  8.541017
#> 152       exp 10.693952
#> 153       exp 12.782147
#> 154       exp  9.094879
#> 155       exp  7.347376
```

## The superiority test (`super_bf()`)

With `super_bf()` we can test whether the experimental group is better
than the control group. Importantly, sometimes low and sometimes high
values on the measure of interest represent superiority, which can be
specified with the argument `direction`. The default is that high values
represent superiority. Moreover, research practices diverge on whether a
one-tailed test should be conducted or a two-tailed test with subsequent
confirmation that the results follow the expected direction. This can be
specified with the argument `alternative`, for which the default is a
one-sided test.

We can use the raw data to compute a Bayes factor:

``` r
mod_super_raw <- super_bf(
  x = data$dv[data$condition == "con"],
  y = data$dv[data$condition == "exp"]
)

mod_super_raw
#> ******************************
#> Superiority analysis
#> --------------------
#> Data:                         raw data
#> H0 (non-superiority):         mu_y == mu_x
#> H1 (superiority):             mu_y > mu_x
#> Cauchy prior scale:           0.707
#> 
#>     BF10 (superiority) = 44.00
#> ******************************

get_bf(object = mod_super_raw)
#> [1] 44.00176
```

Alternatively, if the raw data are not available, we can use summary
statistics to compute a Bayes factor (cf. van Ravenzwaaij et al., 2019).
The data were obtained from Skjerven et al. (2013):

``` r
mod_super_sum <- super_bf(
  n_x = 201,
  n_y = 203,
  mean_x = 68.1,
  mean_y = 63.6,
  ci_margin = (15.5 - (-6.5)) / 2,
  ci_level = 0.95,
  direction = "low",
  alternative = "one.sided"
)

mod_super_sum
#> ******************************
#> Superiority analysis
#> --------------------
#> Data:                         summary data

#> H1 (superiority):             mu_y < mu_x
#> Cauchy prior scale:           0.707
#> 
#>     BF10 (superiority) = 0.24
#> ******************************

get_bf(object = mod_super_sum)
#> [1] 0.2364177
```

## The equivalence test (`equiv_bf()`)

With `equiv_bf()` we can test whether the experimental and the control
groups are equivalent. With the argument `interval`, an equivalence
interval can be specified. The argument `interval_std` can be used to
specify whether the equivalence interval is given in standardised (TRUE;
the default) or unstandardised (FALSE) units. However, in contrast to
the frequentist equivalence test, `equiv_bf()` can also incorporate a
point null hypothesis, which constitutes the default in `equiv_bf()`
(i.e., `interval` = 0).

We can use the raw data to compute a Bayes factor:

``` r
mod_equiv_raw <- equiv_bf(
  x = data$dv[data$condition == "con"],
  y = data$dv[data$condition == "exp"],
  interval = 0.1,
)

mod_equiv_raw
#> ******************************
#> Equivalence analysis
#> --------------------
#> Data:                         raw data
#> H0 (equivalence):             mu_y - mu_x > c_low AND mu_y - mu_x < c_high
#> H1 (non-equivalence):         mu_y - mu_x < c_low OR mu_y - mu_x > c_high
#> Equivalence interval:         Lower = -0.10; Upper = 0.10 (standardised)
#>                               Lower = -0.33; Upper = 0.33 (unstandardised)
#> Cauchy prior scale:           0.707
#> 
#>     BF01 (equivalence) = 0.11
#> ******************************

get_bf(object = mod_equiv_raw)
#> [1] 0.108721
```

Alternatively, if the raw data are not available, we can use summary
statistics to compute a Bayes factor (cf. van Ravenzwaaij et al., 2019).
The data were obtained from Steiner et al. (2015):

``` r
mod_equiv_sum <- equiv_bf(
  n_x = 560,
  n_y = 538,
  mean_x = 8.683,
  mean_y = 8.516,
  sd_x = 3.6,
  sd_y = 3.6
)

mod_equiv_sum
#> ******************************

#> H1 (non-equivalence):         mu_y != mu_x
#> Equivalence interval:         Lower = -0.00; Upper = 0.00 (standardised)
#>                               Lower = -0.00; Upper = 0.00 (unstandardised)
#> Cauchy prior scale:           0.707
#> 
#>     BF01 (equivalence) = 11.05
#> ******************************

get_bf(object = mod_equiv_sum)
#> [1] 11.04945
```

## The non-inferiority test (`infer_bf()`)

With `infer_bf()` we can test whether the experimental group is not
worse by a certain amount–which is given by the non-inferiority
margin–than the control group. Importantly, sometimes low and
sometimes high values on the measure of interest represent
non-inferiority, which can be specified with the argument `direction`.
The default is that high values represent non-inferiority. The
non-inferiority margin can be specified with the argument `ni_margin`.
The argument `ni_margin_std` can be used to specify whether the
non-inferiority margin is given in standardised (TRUE; the default) or
unstandardised (FALSE) units.

We can use the raw data to compute a Bayes factor:

``` r
mod_infer_raw <- infer_bf(
  x = data$dv[data$condition == "con"],
  y = data$dv[data$condition == "exp"],
  ni_margin = 1.5,
  ni_margin_std = FALSE
)

mod_infer_raw
#> ******************************
#> Non-inferiority analysis

#> Data:                         raw data
#> H0 (inferiority):             mu_y - mu_x < -ni_margin
#> H1 (non-inferiority):         mu_y - mu_x > -ni_margin
#> Non-inferiority margin:       0.45 (standardised)
#>                               1.50 (unstandardised)
#> Cauchy prior scale:           0.707
#> 
#>     BF10 (non-inferiority) = 3.18e+10
#> ******************************

get_bf(object = mod_infer_raw)
#> [1] 31814264413
```

Alternatively, if the raw data are not available, we can use summary
statistics to compute a Bayes factor (cf. van Ravenzwaaij et al., 2019).
The data were obtained from Andersson et al. (2013):

``` r

  n_x = 33,
  n_y = 32,
  mean_x = 17.1,
