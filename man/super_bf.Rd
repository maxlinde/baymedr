\description{
\code{\link{super_bf}} computes a Bayes factor for superiority designs.
}
\details{
The Bayes factor resulting from \code{\link{super_bf}} tests the null
hypothesis that the experimental group (e.g., a new medication) is equal to
the control group (e.g., a placebo or an already existing medication). The
formulation of the alternative hypothesis depends on whether a one- or
two-sided test shall be conducted and on whether the low or high values
correspond to superiority. As the name 'superiority' implies, the test is
typically understood as a one-tailed test. In practice, however, a two-tailed
test is often employed, followed by subsequent confirmation that the results
are in the expected direction. To cover both research practices, the user has
the possibility to specify which of these two alternatives should be employed
through the argument \code{alternative}. Furthermore, since sometimes high
scores on the dependent variable are considered superior (e.g., amount of
social interactions) and sometimes rather the low scores (e.g., severity of
symptoms), the user can specify the direction of superiority with the
argument \code{direction}. For the case where higher values on the dependent
variable indicate superiority, the user should specify 'high' (the default)
for the argument \code{direction}; if lower values on the dependent variable
indicate superiority, 'low' should be specified for the argument
\code{direction}. Therefore, in case a two-sided test is employed, the
alternative hypothesis states that the experimental group is not equal to the
control group. In the case of a one-sided test and low scores corresponding
to superiority, the alternative hypothesis is that the experimental group is
lower than the control group. Lastly, in the case where a one-sided test is
employed and high scores indicate superiority, the alternative hypothesis
states that the experimental group is higher than the control group.

Since the main goal of \code{\link{super_bf}} is to establish superiority,
the resulting Bayes factor quantifies evidence in favour of the alternative
hypothesis (i.e., \eqn{BF10}). However, evidence for the null hypothesis can
easily be calculated by taking the reciprocal of the original Bayes factor
(i.e., \eqn{BF01 = 1 / BF10}). Quantification of evidence in favour of the
null hypothesis is logically sound and legitimate within the Bayesian
framework but not in the traditional frequentist framework (see e.g., van
Ravenzwaaij et al., 2019).

Importantly, \code{\link{super_bf}} can be utilized to calculate a Bayes
factor based on raw data (i.e., if arguments \code{x} and \code{y} are
defined) or summary statistics (i.e., if arguments \code{n_x}, \code{n_y},
\code{mean_x}, and \code{mean_y} are defined). In the latter case, the user
has the freedom to supply values either for the arguments \code{sd_x} and
\code{sd_y} \strong{OR} \code{ci_margin} and \code{ci_level}. The choice
should depend on the information that is available to the user. Arguments
with 'x' as a name or suffix correspond to the control group, whereas
arguments with 'y' as a name or suffix correspond to the experimental group
(i.e., the group for which we seek to establish superiority).

For the calculation of the Bayes factor, we chose a Cauchy prior density for
the effect size under the alternative hypothesis. The shape of the Cauchy
distribution can be manipulated with its location and scale parameters. The
standard Cauchy distribution, with a location parameter of 0 and a scale
parameter of 1, resembles a standard Normal distribution, except that the
Cauchy distribution has less mass at the centre but heavier tails (see e.g.,
Rouder et al., 2009, for a visualisation). Mathematically, the standard
Cauchy distribution is equivalent to a Normal distribution with a mean of 0
and a variance that follows and inverse chi-square distribution with one
degree of freedom, for which the variance is integrated out (Liang et al.,
2008). The argument \code{prior_scale} specifies the width of the Cauchy
prior, which corresponds to half of the interquartile range. Thus, by
adjusting the Cauchy prior scale with \code{prior_scale}, we can emphasise
different ranges of effect sizes that might be expected. The default prior
scale is set to \eqn{1 / \sqrt{2}}.

\code{\link{super_bf}} creates an S4 object of class 'baymedrSuperiority',
which has multiple slots/entries (e.g., type of data, prior scale, Bayes
factor, etc.; see Value). If it is desired to store or extract solely the
Bayes factor, the user can do this with \code{\link{get_bf}}, by setting the
S4 object as an argument (see Examples).
