\description{
\code{\link{super_bf}} computes a Bayes factor for superiority designs with a
continuous dependent variable.
}
\details{
The Bayes factor resulting from \code{\link{super_bf}} tests the null
hypothesis (i.e., H0) that the experimental group (e.g., a new medication) is
equal to the control group (e.g., a placebo or an already existing
medication). The formulation of the alternative hypothesis depends on whether
low or high scores on the measure of interest represent superiority. The
direction of superiority can be specified through the argument
\code{direction}. For the case where high values on the dependent variable
indicate superiority, the user should specify 'high' (the default) for the
argument \code{direction}; if low values on the dependent variable indicate
superiority, 'low' should be specified for the argument \code{direction}. If
low scores on the measure of interest represent superiority, the alternative
hypothesis states that the experimental group is lower than the control group
(i.e., H-), whereas if high scores on the measure of interest represent
superiority, the alternative hypothesis states that the experimental
condition is higher than the control group (i.e., H+). Note that the outcome
measure must be continuous.

Since the main goal of \code{\link{super_bf}} is to establish superiority,
the resulting Bayes factor quantifies evidence in favour of the alternative
hypothesis. In the case where low values represent superiority we have BF-0,
whereas in the case where high values represent superiority we have BF+0.
However, evidence for the null hypothesis can easily be calculated by taking
the reciprocal of the original Bayes factor (i.e., BF0- = 1 / BF-0 and BF0+ =
1 / BF+0). Quantification of evidence in favour of the null hypothesis is
logically sound and legitimate within the Bayesian framework (see e.g., van
Ravenzwaaij et al., 2019).

Importantly, \code{\link{super_bf}} can be utilized to calculate a Bayes
factor based on raw data (i.e., if arguments \code{x} and \code{y} are
defined) or summary statistics (i.e., if arguments \code{n_x}, \code{n_y},
\code{mean_x}, and \code{mean_y} are defined). In the latter case, the user
has the freedom to supply values either for the arguments \code{sd_x} and
\code{sd_y} \strong{OR} \code{ci_margin} and \code{ci_level}. Arguments with
'x' as a name or suffix correspond to the control group, whereas arguments
with 'y' as a name or suffix correspond to the experimental group (i.e., the
group for which we seek to establish superiority).

For the calculation of the Bayes factor, we chose a Cauchy prior density for
the effect size under the alternative hypothesis. The shape of the Cauchy
distribution can be manipulated with its location and scale parameters. The
standard Cauchy distribution, with a location parameter of 0 and a scale
parameter of 1, resembles a standard Normal distribution, except that the
Cauchy distribution has less mass at the centre but heavier tails (Liang et
al., 2008; Rouder et al., 2009). The argument \code{prior_scale} specifies
the width of the Cauchy prior, which corresponds to half of the interquartile
range. Thus, by adjusting the Cauchy prior scale with \code{prior_scale}, we
can emphasise different ranges of effect sizes that might be expected. The
default prior scale is set to 1 / sqrt(2).

\code{\link{super_bf}} creates an S4 object of class
\linkS4class{baymedrSuperiority}, which has multiple slots/entries (e.g.,
type of data, prior scale, Bayes factor, etc.; see Value). If it is desired
to store or extract solely the Bayes factor, the user can do this with
\code{\link{get_bf}}, by setting the S4 object as an argument (see Examples).
