\code{\link{infer_bf}} computes a Bayes factor for non-inferiority designs.

\details{
The formulation of the null and alternative hypotheses differ depending on
whether high or low scores on the measure of interest represent
non-inferiority. In the case where high scores correspond to non-inferiority
(e.g., amount of social interaction), the Bayes factor resulting from
\code{\link{infer_bf}} tests the null hypothesis that the experimental group
(e.g., a new medication) is lower than the control group (e.g., a placebo or
an already existing medication) minus a constant value, which is given by the
non-inferiority margin. The alternative hypothesis is that the experimental
group is higher than the control group minus the non-inferiority margin. In
turn, when low values on the measure of interest correspond to
non-inferiority (e.g., severity of symptoms), the Bayes factor resulting from
\code{\link{infer_bf}} tests the null hypothesis that the experimental group
is higher than the control group plus the non-inferiority margin on a
continuous outcome measure. The alternative hypothesis states that the
experimental group is lower than the control group plus the non-inferiority
margin.

Since the main goal of \code{\link{infer_bf}} is to establish
non-inferiority, the resulting Bayes factor quantifies evidence in favour of
the alternative hypothesis (i.e., BF10). However, evidence for the null
hypothesis can easily be calculated by taking the reciprocal of the original
Bayes factor (i.e., BF01 = 1 / BF10). Quantification of evidence in favour of
the null hypothesis is logically sound and legitimate within the Bayesian
framework but not in the traditional frequentist framework (see e.g., van
Ravenzwaaij et al., 2019).

Importantly, \code{\link{infer_bf}} can be utilized to calculate a Bayes
factor based on raw data (i.e., if arguments \code{x} and \code{y} are
defined) or summary statistics (i.e., if arguments \code{n_x}, \code{n_y},
\code{mean_x}, and \code{mean_y} (or \code{ci_margin} and \code{ci_level}
instead of \code{sd_x} and \code{sd_y}) are defined). Arguments with 'x' as a
name or suffix correspond to the control group, whereas arguments with 'y' as
a name or suffix correspond to the experimental group (i.e., the group for
which we seek to establish non-inferiority).

Since sometimes high scores on the dependent variable are considered
non-inferior (e.g., amount of social interactions) and sometimes rather the
low scores (e.g., severity of symptoms), the user can specify the direction
of non-inferiority with the argument \code{direction}. For the case where
higher values on the dependent variable indicate non-inferiority, the user
should specify 'high' (the default) for the argument \code{direction}; if
lower values on the dependent variable indicate non-inferiority, 'low' should
be specified for the argument \code{direction}.

With the argument \code{ni_margin}, the user can determine the
non-inferiority margin. \code{ni_margin} should be a positive number.
Following ethical scientific rigour, \code{ni_margin} should be defined prior
to data collection and data analysis. The user can declare whether the
non-inferiority margin was specified in standardised or unstandardised units
with the \code{ni_margin_std} argument, where TRUE, corresponding to
standardised units, is the default.

For the calculation of the Bayes factor, we chose a Cauchy prior density for
the effect size under the alternative hypothesis. The shape of the Cauchy
distribution can be manipulated with its location and scale parameters. The
standard Cauchy distribution, with a location parameter of 0 and a scale
parameter of 1, resembles a standard Normal distribution, except that the
Cauchy distribution has less mass at the centre but heavier tails (see, e.g.,
Rouder et al., 2009, for a visualisation). Mathematically, the standard
Cauchy distribution is equivalent to a Normal distribution with a mean of 0
and a variance that follows and inverse chi-square distribution with one
degree of freedom, for which the variance is integrated out (Liang et al.,
2008). The argument \code{prior_scale} specifies the width of the Cauchy
prior, which corresponds to half of the interquartile range. Thus, by
adjusting the Cauchy prior scale with \code{prior_scale}, we can emphasise
different ranges of effect sizes that might be expected. The default prior
scale is set to 1 / sqrt(2).

\code{\link{infer_bf}} creates an S4 object of class
\linkS4class{baymedrNonInferiority}, which has multiple slots/entries (e.g.,
type of data, prior scale, Bayes factor, etc.; see Value). If it is desired
to store or extract solely the Bayes factor, the user can do this with
\code{\link{get_bf}}, by setting the S4 object as an argument (see Examples).
