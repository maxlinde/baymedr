Description: BAYesian inference for MEDical designs in R. Functions for the 
    computation of Bayes factors for common biomedical research designs. 
    Implemented are functions to test the equivalence (equiv_bf), 
    non-inferiority (infer_bf), and superiority (super_bf) of an experimental 
    group compared to a control group on a continuous outcome measure. Bayes 
    factors for these three tests can be computed based on raw data (x, y) or 
    summary statistics (n_x, n_y, mean_x, mean_y, sd_x, sd_y [or ci_margin 
    and ci_level]).
