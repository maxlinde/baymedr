Description: BAYesian inference for MEDical designs in R. Convenience functions 
    for the computation of Bayes factors for common biomedical research 
    designs. Implemented are functions to test the equivalence (equiv_bf), 
    non-inferiority (infer_bf), and superiority (super_bf) of an experimental 
    group compared to a control group. Bayes factors for these three tests can
    be computed based on raw data (x, y) or summary statistics (n_x, n_y,
    mean_x, mean_y, sd_x, sd_y [or ci_margin and ci_level]), making it possible 
    to reanalyse findings (e.g., from publications) without the need to obtain 
    the raw data.
