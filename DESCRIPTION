Description: Convenience functions for the computation of Bayes factors for 
    common biomedical research designs. Implemented are functions to test 
    the equivalence (equiv_bf), non-inferiority (infer_bf), and superiority 
    (super_bf) of an intervention group compared to some form of control 
    group.
