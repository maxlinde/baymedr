Description: BAYesian inference for MEDical designs in R. Functions for the 
    computation of Bayes factors for common biomedical research designs. 
    Implemented are functions to test the equivalence (equiv_bf), 
    non-inferiority (infer_bf), and superiority (super_bf) of an experimental 
    group compared to a control group on a continuous outcome measure, as well 
    as functions for simulating survival data and calculating a Bayes factor 
    for Cox proportional hazards models. Bayes factors for these tests can be 
    computed based on raw data or summary statistics.
